        <h3>On torque</h3>
        <p>
        The formula from the Gates documentation requires the torque load (Q) on the drive.
        This value can be computed from the toolhead weight, the gantry weight and acceleration - but that's not implemented, yet.
        You can find the formula with context here; mind that the equation itself is equal for both GT2 and GT3, but of course there are different constants:
        <ul>
            <li>GT3: <a href='https://www.gates.com/content/dam/gates/home/knowledge-center/resource-library/catalogs/light-power-and-precision-manual.pdf'>Current GT3 manual (red), page 65</a></li>
            <li>GT2: <a href='http://files.catalogds.com/domains/gates.pt/pdf/drivedesign_lightpower.pdf'>Old GT2 manual (blue), page 61</a></li>
        </ul>
        You can also find additional information in these documents, e.g. max torque ratings and a lot of other, useful engineering info.<br>
        With GT3 you can essentially ignore torque ratings in this applications; for GT2 torques below 0.25 Nm (2WD!) are safe, above that consult the GT2 docs.
        </p>

        <p>
        If you can not compute/measure the actual torque of your motors:
        As a safe upper bound, you can use your motor's holding torque.
        The result will be too big and you will likely be able to get away with somewhat less tension.
        However, as long as you don't overtension the belt, that doesn't matter.
        </p>
       
        <p>
        <b>On overtensioning:</b>
        There are two scenarios: It's likely that your frame or printed parts are not able to take the force excerted on them.
        As a result, there is a risk of bending your frame or cracking parts.
        </p>

        <p>
        Theoretically, your belt could elongate or even snap.
        I think the previous scenario is more likely, but if you run a 4040 frame and use 4mm GT2 belts, this could happen.
        </p>

        <p>
        Word in the Monolith Discord is that a stock 2020 can be used with 6mm GT3 at recommeded spec, but not 9mm GT3.
        This means a tension of <i>20 lb</i> has <i>probably, maybe, possibly a chance</i> of not bending your extrusions.
        </p>

        <p>
        Or I remember wrong, and it's only 9mm GT2 at 12 lb.
        </p>

        <p>
        Another important factor is the maximum load on the shaft: A stepper's 5mm shaft can only take a low force.
        I found numbers of about 4.4 lb (that's the unit used below), or 20 N.
        Anything above that will destroy your stepper motor.
        <b>That's why there is all the talk of double shear</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
        I recommend you try to figure out how many lbs the stock gantry uses for 6mm GT2.
        Just set density to 0.0083 and try to get to about 150 Hz.
        You'll realize that's way below even 12 lb.
        </p>

        <p>
        If you use any high tension values, be it from Monolith Discord, from this calculator, or whatever:
        You're responsible.
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>Accelerations and weights:</b> I try to compute max accelerations from the given torque.
        The result is the absolute limit of what the system can do, and you will very likely not reach those values (I simplified a few things, most importantly I ignore friciton and rail preload).<br>
        For these computations I need the moved mass.
        The default values are a bad estimate for stock 350mm.<br>
        The weight of the belt is included into my model, but no friction on tensioners (you may add some weight to the toolhead to compensate for that).<br>
        Stealthburner is about 500g (including a 56g MGN12H carriage), but you probably have a different toolhead.<br>
        For the y-assembly: 2020 extrusion are 500g/m, MGN12 rails are 650g/m and MGN9 rail carriages are 26g each. Don't forget the XY joints and steel screws!<br>
        <br>
        Mind that decelerations happen at high rpms, so your motor will have a different torque for those!<br>
        By default, Klipper sets the deceleration limit to half the acceleration; as you will see, you might want to tune that a little bit.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Why should you care for the max accels I produce?</b>
        They show what's possible with the given torque/force transfer capability of your system.
        If you run 40m/s² accelerations anyway on a system that can do 80m/s², you'll only be using a fraction of the torque - meaning you get away with less tension.
        </p>

        <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>
        Using these number could destroy your printer, or cause you to use a too loose belt and being unable to figure out why your print quality sucks.
       
        <b>Remember that a catastrophic failure due to material fatigue mid-print might start a fire and burn down your house.</b>
       
        Either way, use them at your own risk.

        <br>
        The Moons are great for playing with realistic values, since they have nice torque/speed curves on their website.<br>
        E.g. select the 750 rpm and see how limiting your speed can increase accels.<br>
        That should give you an idea how other motors behave.

        <h3>Observations</h3>
        <p>
        If you made it here, you might realize that the tension computed from the formula is nearly the same for GT2 and GT3, and for the belt width.
        </p>

        <p>
        This is no mistake in the calculator:
        The dominant factor in the formula is <i>1.21 * Q / d</i>.
        The torque load <i>Q</i> depends on your motor (that's what you input above).
        And the diameter <i>d</i> of the pulffy depends on the belt pitch, but not on the belt width.
        </p>

        <p>
        The formula has a second term <i>M * S²</i>.
        The mass factor <i>M</i> depends on the belt's mass and is actually dependend on the belt width; but the numbers are small here (0.039 to 0.117).
        And the speed <i>S</i> is the belt speed divided by 1000 (in ft per minute).
        So at 1000 mm/s (or 196.85 ft per minute) we will have something like <i>S = 0.2</i>, and <i>S² = 0.04</i>.
        As a result, this can be virtually ignored (but the computation of course includes it).
